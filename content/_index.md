        + ***May.*** **2025** ðŸŽ‰ Checkout [KORGym](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14552), A Dynamic Game Platform for LLM Reasoning Evaluation. 

        + ***May.*** **2025** ðŸŽ‰ Two papers about how to enhance instruction following have been accepted by ACL 2025 findings! The first paper enhances the [soft contraint following ability of LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04945) and the second paper investigated the [position bias in multi-constraint instruction following](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.17204).

        + ***Apr.*** **2025** ðŸŽ‰ We introduce [Seed1.5-Thinking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13914), capable of reasoning through thinking before responding, resulting in improved performance on a wide range of benchmarks.

        + ***Mar.*** **2025** ðŸŽ‰ Our Instruction Following Benchmark [CELLO](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09150) was used by [Hunyuan-Thinker-1-Preview](https://llm.hunyuan.tencent.com/#/blog/hy-t1) for instruction following evaluation.

        + ***Jan.*** **2025** ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations on our paper [Think Thrice Before You Act: Progressive Thought Refinement in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13413) accepted by ICLR 2025!

        + ***Nov.*** **2024** ðŸ‘€ Joined [ByteDance Seed-LLM-Horizon](https://seed.bytedance.com/en/direction/llm) as a research intern to work on reasoning models.

        + ***Aug.*** **2024** ðŸŽ‰ How to improve LLMs' ability to follow *Complex Instructions*? Congratulations on our paper [From Complex to Simple: Enhancing Multi-Constraint Complex Instruction Following Ability of Large Language Models](https://abbey4799.github.io/publication/constraint/) got accepted to EMNLP 2024 findings!

        + ***May.*** **2024** ðŸ‘€ Joined [StepFun](https://www.stepfun.com/company) Foundation Model Group as a research intern to work on LLM reasoning research.

        + ***May.*** **2024** ðŸ”” Gave a talk at [Alibaba Tongyi Lab](https://tongyi.aliyun.com/), titled: "Complex Instruction Following Ability of Large Language Models". Thanks for the invitation!
